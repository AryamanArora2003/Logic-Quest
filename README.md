# Logic-Quest
Logic Quest is an interactive educational game designed to help users master logic-based problems commonly encountered in discrete mathematics. The game includes a variety of engaging features, such as:

* Instructor Mode: Enables instructors to customize questions, track student progress, and monitor performance.
* Leaderboard: Fosters competition by ranking users based on their achievements.
* Developer Mode: Provides real-time metrics and insights for enhancing the gameplay experience.
* And More: Offering a suite of features tailored for both learners and educators.
This project was developed collaboratively as part of Computer Science 2212 and followed an iterative development process. The team adhered to the software development lifecycle (SDLC), progressing through key phases such as planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow.

This project was developed collaboratively as a class project part of Computer Science 2212 and adhered to an iterative development process within the framework of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The team progressed through key phases, including planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow. At the outset, we collectively created a detailed project proposal to define objectives and scope, followed by a team contract that outlined roles, responsibilities, and communication norms. To guide the systemâ€™s development, we designed UML and use case diagrams to model system interactions and functionality, alongside wireframes to visualize the user interface and improve the user experience. Each sprint focused on refining the product while incorporating feedback to ensure continuous improvement. This project not only provided hands-on experience in full-cycle software development but also helped me develop essential skills in collaboration, communication, and project planning.
